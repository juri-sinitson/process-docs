# About this document
<!-- TOC --><a name="motivation"></a>
## Motivation
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate an approach to a process in an abstract, goal-oriented manner. 
The process is divided into phases, each with its own goals. In this document, the act of taking photos is used 
as an example of such a process. It is broken down into phases, from preparation for shooting to publishing.
The objectives of this document are as follows:
1. It is easy to read
1. It is easily understandable, even for readers not familiar with the topic
1. The process description is as abstract as possible. In this example, it is compatible with any digital camera that supports:
    1. continuous shooting 
    1. adjustment of background blur strength (aka aperture adjustment)
    1. a photo format convenient for a digital processing (aka
raw image format)
    1. protection of user-selected photos from deletion
    1. bulk deletion of photos

## What's not in this document?
This document is maintained at a very abstract level. Therefore, it does not include deep technical details of the process. Specific instructions on how the goals are achieved are also beyond the scope of this document. Additionally, there are no diagrams included; currently, the text is the sole source of information. The glossary was omitted for the sake of simplicity. Instead, simple, abstract, and widely used terms are employed throughout.

The topic of processing, editing and selecting with AI is also beyond the scope of this document. While it can be used in this process, it is not essential.

<!-- TOC --><a name="goal-oriented-approach"></a>
# Goal-Oriented approach
Lower-level goals within the process serve to support higher-level goals. A lower-level goal may be replaced by another if it serves the higher-level goal more effectively. If a process phase no longer has any goals, it should be removed from the process or modified/improved accordingly. Similarly, a step aimed at achieving a phase goal may be replaced with a more efficient alternative.

# Highest-Level Goals or "Why Do This?"
In the case of taking photos, the following high-level goals are applied

1. Joy - especially for family members, social media followers and personal satisfaction
2. Sharing and exchange with other photographers
3. Preserving memories

<!-- TOC --><a name="note"></a>
## NOTE
Highest-level goals should be defined first, before any initiation or acquisition of hardware or software equipment. Also note that artistic value is - and will remain - a very important goal. However, in this example, it serves the higher-level goals, particularly joy.

<!-- TOC --><a name="achieved-by"></a>
## Achieved by
1. Each photo should be unique and have artistic value; the rest are deleted
1. Photos are published through various digital and analog channels, especially 
   1. family messenger groups
   1. social media
   1. wallpapers on personal mobile and desktop devices
   1. slide show devices at home and/or at relatives' home
   1. large and small format print for the walls at home
   1. yearly printed photo albums and calendars for relatives
1. Time is saved in processing and publishing

<!-- TOC --><a name="phase-before-the-shooting"></a>
# Phase "before the shooting"

<!-- TOC --><a name="goals"></a>
## Goals
1. Identify the best motif, its best perspective - and, if applicable, the best lighting
1. Joy for all participants during walks or hikes

<!-- TOC --><a name="achieved-by-1"></a>
## Achieved by
Choose the ideal perspective for photographing the main subject to ensure the most pleasing (blurred) background and, if applicable, the best lighting. The appropriate degree of background blur is also selected for the subject.

When walking or hiking with other persons, minimize the need for spontaneous waiting. Remember which motifs require them to pause, and inform them in advance. Try to stay with the (sub)group to avoid missing out on conversations.

When photographing fast-moving subjects (e.g. dance or sports) or (quickly) transitioning subjects (e.g. blowing on a dandelion), use continuous shooting. Trigger it slightly before the key movement or transition begins. Note that some cameras support automatic premature continuous shooting, such as while focusing on the subject.

When photographing, for example, a passing train, choose the best perspective before the action starts.

# Phase "by the shooting"

<!-- TOC --><a name="goals-1"></a>
## Goals
1. Save time and/or mental energy in the subsequent phases of the process

<!-- TOC --><a name="achieved-by-2"></a>
## Achieved by
1. Protect the best photos
1. Delete a photo when a better one (e.g. taken in the current year) will clearly win the comparison
1. Use bulk deletion to remove the remaining photos on the camera in one action

<!-- TOC --><a name="note-1"></a>
### NOTE
A motif should not be repeated. For example, when photographing a child in different poses, only the best pose, gaze, background blur,  lighting and shadows, etc. should be kept. The rest should be deleted.

<!-- TOC --><a name="phase-select"></a>
# Phase "select"

<!-- TOC --><a name="goals-2"></a>
## Goals
1. Filter out the best photos to maximize joy and save time during processing

<!-- TOC --><a name="achieved-by-3"></a>
## Achieved by
1. Copy the photos to the desktop PC and compare similar motifs from the current year. Create separate folders for each recurring motif (e.g. `train`, `architecture`, `nuremberg-old-town`, etc.) to speed up the comparison process.
2. If a newly copied photo wins the comparison, keep it; otherwise, delete it

<!-- TOC --><a name="phase-processing"></a>
# Phase "processing"

<!-- TOC --><a name="goals-3"></a>
## Goals
1. Speed up the next phase
1. Increase the artistic value

<!-- TOC --><a name="achieved-by-4"></a>
## Achieved by
<!-- TOC --><a name="bulk-renaming"></a>
### Bulk renaming
Before processing, the source photos should be bulk renamed, for example, in the following lowercase format:

`yyyy-mm-dd_land-abbreviation_town-or-locality_description_original-name_addition.extension`.

Example:

Given multiple source files from `IMGP8990.DNG` till `IMGP9001.DNG`. After bulk renaming, the source files will be renamed as follows:

from

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp8990.dng` 

till

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp9001.dng`

The description and the addition are optional. In the example above, the addition was omitted.

Note that when using bulk renaming the selected files are renamed in a single, quick step. 
This eliminates the need to manually rename each file one by one.
Depending on the operating system and desktop environment, bulk renaming may be directly 
supported by the file manager. If not, additional software is required.

<!-- TOC --><a name="processing-the-source-photos"></a>
### Processing the source photos
Each source photo is processed using software that applies a custom profile automatically. When necessary, the profile parameters are manually adjusted for each photo individually. Photos are typically processed by converting them to black and white. For artistic goals, a combination with the color layer of the same photo may be used - for example, slightly retaining the color in the eyes of a portrait to better draw the viewer’s focus.

Only the most representative photos are fully processed in color. In such cases, colors may be harmonized - for instance, by 
weakening or removing colors that clash with the overall composition. A common example is the presence of bright orange, yellow, or blue winter jackets, which often do not harmonize with nature or architectural scenes. In these situations, the jacket colors are either weakened or replaced with their black and white versions.

Assuming the source files have meaningful names - for example, through the use of bulk renaming software - each process (by-)output file will then automatically carry the same meaningful name as its source file, with the appropriate extension (e.g. .jpg, .pp3, .jpg.out.pp3 or any other format depending on the by-output and the processing software used).

For example for the source file:

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp9001.dng`

the resulting output will be:

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp9001.jpg`

This output is the resulting (or “final”) photo, generally ready for publication. Additional publishing actions are likely when preparing the photo for a print or a social media channel.

Its by-output (in this case, the profile used to produce the final photo) will be:

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp9001.jpg.out.pp3` 

Note that there may be complex cases, such as combining multiple resulting photos from the same source into a single resulting photo. Depending on the software used for processing the source file and for combining its outputs, the by-output may have the same extension as the resulting photo. In such cases, using a name addition may be appropriate - for example:

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp9001_color-layer.jpg` 

and, if applicable, its profile can then be renamed as follows

`2025-04-13_de_altdorf_prackenfels+teufelshoehle_imgp9001_color-layer.jpg.out.pp3`
