# About this document
## What is this document?
This goal of this document is to describe my making of photos in an abstract process oriented way.
This is done in phases (from preparing to shoot until the publishing), why I do those phases and 
how I achieve the goals. This abstract description strives to be: 
1. easy readable
1. well understandable especially for people not dealing with photography
1. compatible with every digital camera which
    1. is capable of making continuous shooting 
    1. supports tweaking the strength of background blurryness (aka aperture)
    1. is capable to shoot in a format convenient for a digital processing (aka
raw image format)

## What is this document not?
This document is very process oriented and thus kept an very abstract level. Thus there are no
technical details like which camera, which lens, which processing software, which raw format,
etc. Because of the reason above there are also no concrete instructions of how the goals are 
achieved exactly.

# General
## Goals
1. Joy
1. Exchange with others
1. Memories

## Achieved by
1. Each photo should be unique and have an artistic value, the rest is deleted (the **Less is more**-Principle). 
1. The photos are published to different channels. 
1. The processing and publishing time is saved.

# Phase "before the shooting"

## Goals
1. Find out the best motif
1. Joy for all the participants when walking/hiking with other persons

## Achieved by
Find out best best background motif (in the blurryness). Find out the best strength of the blurryness for the background motif.

When walking/hiking with other persons, let them wait spontaneously as less as possible. Remember the motifs where they have to wait and inform them timely. Try to stick with the (sub)group to not miss the conversation.

When shooting a fast moving object(s) (e.g. dance or sports) or a (fast) transitioning object(s) (e.g. blowing on a dandelion), use continuous shooting. Trigger continuous shooting prematurely shortly before the relevant movement or transition begins.

In case of shooting e.g. a passing train choose the best perspective before the start.

# Phase "by the shooting"

## Goals
1. Save time and/or mental energy in the next process phases

## Achieved by
1. Protect the best photos
1. Delete current photo when the other photo taken e.g. in the current year will definitely win the comparison
1. Delete the rest

# Phase "select"

## Goals
1. Filter out the best photos for most joy and to save time by the processing

## Achieved by
1. Copy the photos to the PC and compare similar motifs of the current year. Crate different dirs for every motif like `nature`, `train`, `family`, `architecture` etc to accelerate the comparison.
2. If a new copied photo wins the comparison, leave it otherwise delete it

### NOTE!
A motif should not repeat especially in the session. When e.g. the child is photographed in different poses, only the best pose, gaze, blurryness of the background, aperture, lights/shadows etc. is selected, the rest is deleted.

# Phase "processing"

## Goals
1. Increase the artistic value

## Achieved by
Each photo is processed digitally by applying a custom profile automatically and tweaking its parameters for every photo individually when necessary. Photos are processed in black and white. For artistic goals a combination with the color version might be made, e.g. making eyes very slightly in color for better observer focus. Only the most representative photos are processed fully in color. In case of fully color the colors might be harmonized, e.g. by blanking out the colors not suiting the rest of the photo. As a typical example a mixture of loud orange, yellow or blue winter jackets is usually not in harmony with a nature or an architecture motif. In this case the colors of those jackets are blanked or even replaced with their black and white version.

# Phase "store"
## Goals
1. To joy later e.g by memories and printing

## Achieved by
1. The resulting photos are the output of processing and are stored separately from their source photos.
1. The by-output of processing the source photos (the resulting processing profiles per photo, masks, additional layers, etc.) is stored together with the source photos and have similar name always beginning with date the in format yyyy-mm-dd.


# Phase "publish"
## Goals
1. Digital joy (also by exchanging and getting badges like faves, likes, emojis, etc.)
2. Print joy by DIN-A4-Albums or large format printings

## Achieved by
1. Sharing the photos e.g. in messenger (family) groups
2. Sharing the photos in social media

## Security practices in social media

### Goals
1. To avoid/reduce an (easy) prediction date of e.g. being not at home or being at certain place
1. To avoid accidental position exposing e.g. of your home or your hosts home
1. Avoid misuses

### Achieved by
1. Omitting the date in the resulting photo if it's not safe to publish
1. Omitting the the position coordinates in the resulting photo if it's not safe to publish
1. Postponing the date of publishing if you visit e.g. your relatives at the same date(s) of the year 
or during the same celebration(s)
1. Thinking multiple times before publishing photos which children
